# CSS_305_Final_Project
Points Breakdown:
• Project: 75 points
• Presentation and Video: 20 points
• Peer Evaluations: 5-point

# Project Overview

- This is a full-stack web application that demonstrates CRUD functionality, authentication, database integration, and secure data handling within a website that will be hosted on Hostinger.
- The application will include separate frontend and backend components, server-side validation, dynamic database operations using prepared statements, and complete documentation required for the final submission.

# The 5 W's
- **Who**: This application is designed for employees and managers of a car parts store, including inventory clerks, counter staff, and store managers who need quick access to stock and product information
- **What**: The system will be a web based inventory management application or catalog that allows users to view, add, edit, and delete car parts, track stock levels, search for specific items, and manage supplier relationships. It provides a centralized location to store and update all inventory related data
- **When**: The system is used daily during store operations whenever staff need to check stock, receive shipments, adjust quantities, or assist customers by looking up parts
- **Where**: The application will be hosted on Hostinger, allowing authorized users to access it from store computers, office desktops, or approved remote locations
- **Why**: Car parts stores handle extensive inventories with frequent stock changes. Manual tracking can lead to errors, shortages, and lost sales. This system streamlines inventory control, reduces mistakes, improves efficiency, provides real time stock visibility, and supports better decision making for restocking and sales operations

# Project Goals
• Make sure we implement CRUD operations

• Capture user input and store it in a relational SQL database

• Retrieve data using SQL SELECT statements and display results dynamically on webpages

• Use authentication to protect pages that are restricted

• Test and debug security issues throughout development

• Host the functioning web application using Hostinger

• Make sure everything is documented with a transparent development process

# Repository
This repository will include:
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frontend files
- Backend server files
- Validator scripts
- Database structure files
- layout drawings using Lucidchart
- Database diagram
- Documentation file/folder
- Deployment details
- Validator scripts

# Development Notes
This readme will be updated regularly throughout the project to show progress, changes, and final implementation details.
